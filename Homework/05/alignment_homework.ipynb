That, in itself, is amazing that multiple tornadoes would hit the same town at night in the fall - in Nebraska. I wonder if the real town ' s name was close to \" Blainsworth \" ( which is the town ' s name in the movie ). There is an Ainsworth, Nebraska, but there is also a town that starts with Blains - something. < br / > < br / > It does show the slowest moving tornadoes on record in the the seen where the boys are in the house. On the other hand, the scene where the TV goes fuzzy is based in fact. Before Doppler radar and weather radio, we were taught that if you turned your TV to a particular channel ( not on cable ) and tuned the brightness just right, you could tell if there was a tornado coming. The problem was that by then you would be able to hear it. < br / > < br / > Since I know something about midwest tornadoes, it made this movie fun for me. I enjoy it more than Twister. I mean, give me a break - there is no way you could make it through and F5 by chaining yourself to a pipe in a well house.

Long, long story short, these people get \"terrorized\" by this pathetic \"crazed killer\", but completely fail to fight back in any manner. And this is after they take a raft on a camping trip, with no gear, and show up at a campsite that is already assembled and completely stocked with food and clothes and the daughters headphones. Additionally, after their boat goes missing, they panic that they're stuck in the woods, but then the daughters boyfriend just shows up and they apparently never consider that they could just hike out of the woods like he did to get to them. Like I said, this movie sucks. A complete joke. Don't let your girlfriend talk you into watching it.\n",
